        <h3 id="news2">LEALMAN, Fla. - Lealman firefighters are being called heroes by one family for helping rescue some of their pets early Friday morning.

The fire broke out around 4:20 a.m. at a home on the 3700 hundred block of 57th Avenue North.

The family says they were alerted to the fire by the smell of smoke and a neighbor who woke them up.

Five people were inside the house when the fire began. Everyone got out but one person suffered some smoke inhalation. A dog also made it out without help.

Firefighters went into the burning home and rescued the family's two pet cats. All the animals are doing fine.

Crew kept the flames contained to the rear of the house. The fire did about $30,000 worth of damage.

Investigators say the fire began at the back of the home and believe it may be electrical in nature.

The American Red Cross responded to the scene. It is unknown what aid the family may require until the home is fully livable again.</h3>

        <h1 id="cats2">Fangstar's Adventure (a warriors story)</h1>
        <h4> Fangkit opened his eyes. He looked around at the new world. His littermate, Icekit had not opened her eyes yet. His other littermate, Sandkit, had just opened her eyes too. "Mother?, can we go outside and explore?" asked Sandkit. "Not until your a quarter moon old. Its still to dangerous. Said Leafheart, the she-cat queen who was the three kit's mother. "Thats not fair!" Yelled Sandkit. "I Want to explore ThunderClan camp now!<br><br>

FIVE DAYS LATER...<br><br>

Icekit had opened her eyes a long time ago. Fangkit and SandKit were exploring ThunderClan camp. "Wow!" said Fangkit. "What is that?" Sandkit asked. "Lets check it out" said Fangkit. As they went in they heard a grow. "What are you doing? This is the Warriors den!" "Sorry!" said Sandkit " We didn't know." "Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey join here beneth highrock for a clan meeting!" Firestar yowled. "Mother can we go to the meeting?" asked Sandkit. "of course you can go! " said Leafheart. "Okay!" meowed Sandkit. "Today I want to appoint two new  apprentices" said Firestar, leader of ThunderClan. "Sandkit, from this day on until you have earned your warrior name you will be called Sandpaw." Firestar paused to get a breath. "Brambleclaw, you will mentor Sandpaw, I hope you pass on what you have learned to this appendence. " "I will" said Brambleclaw. "Fangkit, you will be known as Fangpaw. Dustpelt, you will mentor Fangpaw." "Sandpaw!" "Fangpaw!" "Fangpaw!" "Sandpaw!" all the cats cheered.<br><br>

ONE MOON LATER...(one month later)<br><br>

"Fight me " said Dustpelt. Fangpaw launched himself in the air at Dustpelt. But Dustpelt was too fast. Dustpelt had aready dodged the blow. "Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey join here beneath highrock for a clan meeting." "What does he want now?" some of the elders grumbled. It was true, Firestar held a lot of clan meetings recently.  "I would like to make a new  apprentice today. Icekit you will be known as Icepaw." "Squirrelflight, you will mentor Icepaw " "Icepaw!" "Icepaw!" The clan cheered.<br><br>

 TWO MOONS LATER...(two months later)<br><br>

"Fangpaw, do you promise to uphold the warrior code, even with the power of your life?" Questioned Firestar. "I do" Meowed Fangpaw. "Than by the powers of Starclan I give you your warrior name. Fangtooth, Starclan will honor you for your strength and courage"<br><br>

FIVE MOONS LATER...(five months later)<br><br>

"Fangtooth, Fangtooth!" "What is it?" asked Fangtooth. "Firestar has died in the battle against Tigerstar in the dark forest " Meowed Brambleclaw. "Firestar? No, no, no ,no!" Fangtooth wailed. "But wait! What is the dark forest?" Asked Fangtooth. "The drk forest is where cats go if they do not believe in Starclan" Said Brambleclaw. "Oh, But how did Firestar die?" Questioned Fangtooth. "He died from wounds from a burning tree" Meowed Brambleclaw. "But since you are deputy " Continued Brambleclaw. "That means you are clan leader now" Meowed Brambleclaw happily.<br><br>

ONE DAY LATER...<br><br>

Fangtooth was on the journey to the pool where he will get his 9 lives and his leadership. He brought his littermates, Sandpelt and Iceclaw. When they got to the pool, Fangtooth drank the water of the pool and feel into sleep... "Fangtooth, It is time for your nine lives" said his mother, in Starclan. "I give you a live of courage, I hope you use it with your clanmates. " said his mother. When he got this life, he felt pain and he saw fighting and blood all over the place. "I give you a life for caring for your clanmates" It was Bluestar, former leader of Thunderclan before Firestar. Fangtooth felt another ripple of pain. He saw more fighting and cats with there claws outstretched. "Fangtooth my deputy, now my leader" Firestar was speaking to him. "I give you a life of  love. care for you clan" Fangtooth expected another ripple of pain. But instead he felt a wonderful feeling and  he saw his clan at peace...<br><br>

ONE MOON LATER...<br><br>

It was time for Fangstar's first  meeting at the island, where all the clans meet. He lead his cats across the fallen tree and onto the island...
